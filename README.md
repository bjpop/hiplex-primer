hiplex-primer
=============

Please see [the Hiplex-primer web page](http://bjpop.github.io/hiplex-primer/) for more information about using the tool.

This tool does not account for primer-dimer formation. Users are advised to post-process the design outputs to check for and minimise potential primer-dimer formation.

This program takes a simplistic approach to estimating primer melting temperature. We advise users to implement a more sophisticated approach, such as a nearest neighbour-based method.
